Web page creation platform
Description
We are a platform for creating online stores without the need for programming knowledge. We have different sections such as "stores" where you can view all available stores, as well as add or remove them from favorites and visit each store's page. In the "MyStore" section, you can create your own store, add products, edit and delete them, edit your store's banner and logo, delete your store permanently, and link payments through MercadoPago. As the platform administrator, you can activate/deactivate/delete any store, user or general product.
